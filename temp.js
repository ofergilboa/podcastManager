Each episode, we follow the experience of one of Vanessa Zoltan's friends who is writing their very first romance novel. Vanessa is joined by Julia Quinn, her favorite Romance novelist, to discuss romance novel tropes and what it takes to write a Romance novel. Along the way, we find meaning in the mundane, treat the secular as a sacred, and build communities of supportive and creative friends.",

            "description": "No Agenda is like having a conversation with your favorite online creators. Each show is a portal into their inspiration, values and vision.\n\nThe internet is great for introverts like us. We now can hang out with like minded and inspiring people, from the comfort of home. Each show isn't a speech, or a \"webinar.\" It’s a transmission of creative energy, artistic insight and shared internet obsessions.\n\nWhat we get is a feeling of connection through discovery, as we peruse the week, lead by our favorite creators through rabbit holes and topics to explore. Tune in to listen to Artists and Creators play, work, and be themselves. \n\nNO AGENDA – DIFFERENT ARTIST EVER FRIDAY AT ~11 PS",

What he isn’t prepared for are the bewildering new emotions he feels when he meets the handsome Amir, a rival prince on a quest to save his own realm. Forced to team up, the two princes soon discover that the only thing more difficult than saving their kingdoms is following their hearts. \n\nThe Two Princes stars Noah Galvin (Booksmart, Dear Evan Hansen), Ari’el Stachel (The Band’s Visit), Christine Baranski (The Good Wife, The Good Fight), Shohreh Aghdashloo (House of Sand and Fog, The Expanse), Matthew Rhys (The Americans), Samira Wiley (Orange Is the New Black, The Handmaid’s Tale).

With few opportunities to gather and little access to biblical teaching, our persecuted brothers and sisters may meet for eight to twelve hours at a time simply to sing, pray, and study God’s Word. This God-centered focus is a helpful corrective to the desire for entertainment that characterizes many church gatherings in the U.S.Encouraged by our persecuted brothers and sisters’ example, each year, we gather for over 6 hours of intense study of God's Word and passionate prayer for the persecuted led by pastor, teacher, and author David Platt.",

From a dirt-poor boy raised amid the hustlers, pimps, and whores of turn-of-the-century New Orleans, Louis Armstrong mastered his music and became a figure larger than life. He helped create that most American of music genres: Jazz. Over his lifetime, he became one of the most recognizable personalities on the planet. He traveled the world, conquered music, radio, and film, overcame prejudice, spread joy, and convinced us all that this really can be \"a wonderful world.\"",

In this nuts-and-bolts, no-nonsense podcast, you'll discover how to get better clients, earn more in less time, and bring more freedom and joy into your writing business. Ed will walk you through the practical, “doable” systems and strategies he has developed in his own writing business — the same systems he has taught his private coaching clients. He'll also show you what’s working for other business writers by bringing you real case studies from the field. And he'll share all this information in an honest and transparent way, with no hype or fluff. Topics covered include: getting better and higher-paying clients; banishing the feast-or-famine cycle; doing more of the work that excites you; how to raise your fees and rates; boosting your productivity; making your business recession-proof; discovering and leveraging your strengths; finding your niche; pricing content writing projects; pricing copywriting projects; writing white papers; writing case studies; writing web copy; writing articles; and much more.",

But jewelry can tell a larger story, one reflecting the connection between contemporary culture and that of yesteryear.\n\nIs jewelry clothing, art, status symbol, or something more? The jewelry world seems to be hidden in plain sight and little understood. The Jewelry Journey podcast explores the many aspects of jewelry and its status as art. We talk with those who live and breathe this form of adornment: makers, dealers, gallerists, academics collectors and more. The goal is to elevate the conversation beyond Etsy or big diamonds and see jewelry in a new light, so that we can appreciate the little pieces of wonder that float by each day.",

We talk health, wellness, self-care, work/life balance, and everything in between. Tune in to see how others are making it work and gain practical insights on what it means to create a healthy, happy, uniquely balanced life.",

On goopfellas, two friends who have become familiar with unlikely personal transformations have raw conversations with people who have experienced profound shifts in perspective and well-being. Together, functional medicine practitioner Will Cole, DC, and chef Seamus Mullen get at the catalysts that bring people out of their dark night and into their purpose. Each of their goopfellas guests—from athletes to actors to authors—is different. As are the hosts: Mullen himself almost died from rheumatoid arthritis, and Cole’s day job is helping people uncover and overturn the roots of dis-ease. But you’ll likely see pieces of yourself in all their conversations, reflected in every one of their challenges. And we hope, from the lessons they learned along the way, you’ll find something you need to bring about a change, big or small, in your own life.",

The story we learn starts with Sputnik, then President Kennedy’s challenge, and ends with triumph: an American flag on the lunar surface. But in the 50 years that have passed since the moon landing, as presidential documents have been declassified and secret programs have been revealed, a wilder story has begun to emerge. “Moonrise,” a new Washington Post narrative mini-series, digs into the nuclear arms race of the Cold War, the transformation of American society and politics, and even the birth of science fiction, to unearth what really drove us to the moon. Join host Lillian Cunningham as she uncovers a story that has so much to reveal about America -- and about the dreams and nightmares of being human on this Earth.",

            "description": "The biggest moments in sports history have stories behind them which have never been told. In 1999, Brandi Chastain kicked the winning goal for the U.S. at the Women’s World Cup. Her victory celebration in a sports bra made for one of the most iconic photos in recent memory. But how did we get to a moment where a women’s sport became a national obsession? To answer that question, we have to go back. In Season 1, soccer journalist Grant Wahl traces that ’99 Women’s World Cup victory back to the origins of the U.S. women’s national team and the first Women’s World Cup in 1991. Featuring superstars like Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers and Julie Foudy; former coach, Anson Dorrance; and even ex-FIFA President, Sepp Blatter. ",

The Indie Hackers Podcast dives even deeper into the stories, challenges, and tactics behind the people who are bootstrapping and growing their own indie businesses.<br><br>I talk to people like Mike Carson, the founder of Park.io, who makes over $1.5MM/month from his one-man operation. People like Christy Laurence, who got an app built from scratch despite not knowing how to code herself, grew revenue to $1MM in the first year, and who now employs dozens of people.&nbsp;I interview founders who are just getting started turning their brand new ideas into businesses, so we get an authentic glimpse at what the early days look like. I even bring on the occasional Silicon Valley tech founder, so we can see what it's like to raise millions of dollars from investors and move at breakneck speed.<br><br>In every episode we discuss the highs and lows of a founder's journey, what it's like to risk it all and lose, and the amazing lifestyle changes that comes from hard-earned success. We dive into the fundamentals behind getting started, coming up with promising ideas, testing the market to see if they'll work, building an app or a website, finding your first customers, building a team (or staying solo), scaling up from a few hundred in revenue all the way to millions or hundreds of millions, and what to do once you've reached your goals.<br><br>Whether you're currently running your own business or you're an aspiring entrepreneur who's just tinkering, on this show you'll learn by example how to become a financially independent indie hacker, and I guarantee you'll have fun doing it!</p>",

            "description": "More often than we’d like to believe, people get away with murder. As cases grow cold, cops retire. Witnesses die. Evidence disappears. Unsolved, a true crime podcast series from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, guides listeners through these real-life mysteries, uncovering new clues along the way.\nSeason three of Unsolved tells the story of Father Alfred Kunz, whose throat was slit inside St. Michael School in 1998. Some believe his death was linked to his battles against evil. Others believe his all-too-human flaws were to blame.\nSeason two of Unsolved, released in 2017, examines the case of toddler Michelle Manders, who vanished from her bedroom in the middle of the night in 1981. Did she wander alone into the darkness? Or was she kidnapped?\nSeason one of Unsolved, released in 2015, explores the circumstances surrounding the death of 14-year-old John Zera, who disappeared from Franklin High School in 1976. The seven episodes follow investigators through decades of dead ends as they hold on to hope of finding the killer.\nSubscribe to Unsolved on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher Radio or wherever you get your podcasts.
