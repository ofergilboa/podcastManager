        "description_original": "On this edition of Nuketown Radio Active I return from a far-too-long hiatus to talk about the year that was and the year that will be. Topping that list is a look at the redesigned, Drupal-7 powered Nuketown and a return to geeky writing.\nWith site news out of the way I take a look at the RPG and Xbox 360 games I&#8217;ve been playing and put out the call for PS3 game suggestions. Finally, I round out the podcast with some thoughts on the upcoming Star Wars Trilogy.\nGetting the Show\n\nDownload the MP3 directly\n\nShow Notes\nNuketown News\n\nI&#8217;m back! It&#8217;s been over a year &#8230; but the podcast is back! We&#8217;ll be focusing on shorter shows for the immediate future &#8212; in the 10-20 minute range.\nEventful year. Got promoted to director at work, which ate up a lot of free time, and launched a mobile optimized web presence at work &#8230; which ate up even more! Kids are doing well, wife is doing well, job is doing well. The only thing that&#8217;s not doing well? My free time&#8230;\nNuketown is redesigned! What free time I had went to redesigning Nuketown and upgrading it from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7. It&#8217;s now done &#8230; or done enough to launch. Look for further improvements in coming weeks as I take care of the lingering issues.\nBack to Basics: The last year has been terribly stressful, and I miss Nuketown. Now that the site is upgraded, I plan on getting back to writing, podcasting, and the other geeky things I haven&#8217;t been doing enough of.\n\nPromo:\n\nAccidental Survivors\n\nMy Gaming life\n\nRPGs: Pathfinder: Second Darkness: After two years of Star Wars we returned to our d20 roots with a fantasy campaign set in Paizo&#8217;s Golarion setting, follow their Second Darkness adventure path\nXbox 360: Borderlands 2: All guns, all the time. My Xbox has rarely been so happy.\nPlayStation 3: I got it for my birthday and Christmas last year but so far I&#8217;ve only played MLB: The Show and watched a lot of Blu-rays. It&#8217;s time to change that: what games should I get?\n\nGeek News\n\nNew Star Wars movies: Episodes 7, 8, and 9 are on their way, with the first arriving in 2015. George Lucas has sold Lucasfilm to Disney, and it&#8217;s the best thing that could have happened; Lucas still has influence, but someone else is writing and directing.\n\nContact Us\n\nEmail: nuketown@gmail.com\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/nukehavoc\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/nuketownsf\n",
